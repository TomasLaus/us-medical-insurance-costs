# Data Science Project: U.S. Medical insurance costs

Analysis on Various Factors Affecting Insurance Costs of U.S. Adults

In this project, I intend to analyze a sample of insurance costs of individuals across the United States, classified by age, sex, bmi, number of children, and inhabiting region. Through my analysis, I aim to find out:

- The variable that has the largest correlation to the cost of health insurance charges
- How the smoking habits in each sex affect the insurance charges
- How the insurance charges differ (and maybe why) in each age group.


###### Note: The dataset 'insurance.csv' was acquired from CodeCademy.com.
